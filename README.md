# Double Spend Attack with Checkpoints

## Description
This repository contains statistical calculations of the probability of a double spend attack for Proof of Stake (PoS) and Proof of Work (PoW) protocols using checkpoints.

## File Structure
- **PoS.py** – script for calculating the probability of a double spend attack in Proof of Stake with checkpoints.
- **PoW.py** – script for calculating the probability of a double spend attack in Proof of Work with checkpoints.

## Usage
Run the corresponding script for analysis:
```bash
python PoS.py  # Analysis for PoS
python PoW.py  # Analysis for PoW
